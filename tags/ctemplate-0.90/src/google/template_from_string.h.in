// The TemplateFromString class implements a template that is instantiated
// from a string rather than from a file. Like its parent, Template, instances
// are retrieved via its GetTemplate static method, rather than new'ing
// them directly. This GetTemplate has a different parameter list, taking
// both a logical name (template_name) and the text of the template itself
// as a string (template_text). The logical name is used to cache the
// parse template structure. Therefore, it is important to always pass any
// given name with the same template text string, or at least realize that
// the template text string will be ignored on second and subsequent calls
// given the same name.

// Unlike the file-based Template class, there is no way to "Reload" a
// template once it has been retrieved (nor should there be any need
// to do so, as there is no file that might have changed after the
// initial "loading"). Therefore, the methods Reload, ReloadIfChanged,
// and the parent's GetTemplate have all been made private in this
// derived class and given definitions which will produce fatal errors
// with a message to the developer that these are invalid calls.  If
// you call ReloadAllIfChanged() and it affects a string template, it
// will mark the template to be reloaded (ReloadAllIfChanged() always
// does this; it never actually does any reloading itself), but that
// mark will be subsequently ignored.

 public:
  /* GetTemplate
     Parameters:
       (NOTE: The parameter list is not the same as Template::GetTemplate.)
       cache_key - the cache string used for the template text.
       template_text - the text of the template containing the template
                       code with markers, the very same language that
                       would be stored in a file for the parent class
       strip - same as the parent class
     Description:
       Attempts to find an instance of the class with the given cache_key
       stored in the cache. If it finds one, it returns it, ignoring the
       template_text passed to the method.
       If it does not find one, it creates a new instance of the class,
       stores it in the cache under the template_name, and returns it.
       Note: since cache lookup is by key, you can't have two instances
       with the same key but different text, and expect it to work.
       However, if cache_key is the empty string, we ignore the cache,
       and always create a new instance of the class (without storing it
       in the cache).  In this case *only*, you're responsible for
       deleting the returned TemplateFromString object when done with it.

  //   Same logic as GetTemplate above except it also enables

  //   it is only useful when you are using the Template System in the
  //   context of web-applications which operate on untrusted
  //   content that requires proper escaping when expanded into the template.
  //   In order to automatically determine the correct escaping to apply
  //   to all variable substitutions, the Template System becomes
  //   "HTML-aware" and parses the template during initial creation.
  //
  //   TemplateContext must match the context in which the template
  //   is being returned or the auto-escaping will be wrong.
